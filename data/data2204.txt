#Microsoft Windows PNG IHDR block DoS poc
#More info: http://www.xsec.org/index.php?module=Releases&act=view&type=1&id=6
#Written by Preddy
#
#don't create the poc png file on windows it won't work as it should
#when i create it on windows with activeperl or visual c it doesn't work !!??!!
#you can try if you want to..it didn't work for me because of some weird magical windows reason..
#the png header becomes: 89 50 4e 47 0d 0d
#instead of            : 89 50 4e 47 0d 0a
#
#I currently have no single idea WHY it does that...
#so use linux to compile/run the script or the program

                        The Exploit Database is maintained by Offensive Security, an information security training company
                        that provides various Information Security Certifications as well as high end penetration testing services. The Exploit Database is a
                        non-profit project that is provided as a public service by Offensive Security.
                    
The Exploit Database is a CVE
                            compliant archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
                        developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
                        the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
                        lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
                        easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
                        proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
                        actionable data right away.
                    
The Google Hacking Database (GHDB)
                        is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
                        and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
                        this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
                        information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
                        subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.
                    
The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
                        Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
                        Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
                        member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
                        by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
                        recorded at DEFCON 13. Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
                        to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
                        the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
                        unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
                        Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
                        information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
                        show examples of vulnerable web sites.
                    
After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
                        over to Offensive Security in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
                        an extension of the Exploit Database. Today, the GHDB includes searches for
                        other online search engines such as Bing,
                        and other online repositories like GitHub,
                        producing different, yet equally valuable results.
